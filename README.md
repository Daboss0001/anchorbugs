# Anchor Bug Reporting 

Hi :wave:, welcome to the official bug reporting page for Anchor Public. Developed by **Daboss#0001**.


## Reporting Requirements
:bug: *Reports should only be used for bugs. Other reports will be ignored and could result in being blocked from making future bug reports.*

We expect all reports to contain the following elements.

`Severity:` Bug severity, is it something that needs to be addressed immediately?
> `P0` and `P1` bugs are the highest severity. P0 means the bot is taken offline due to the bug. A `P1` bug means that it may crash part of the bot, but not completely take it offline. 
> 
> `P2` bugs may be smaller features that aren't working correctly. Say maybe the bot is replying with `null` in a command.
>
>`P3` bugs are the least severe, maybe a small typo in the bot.

`Expected Result:` This is what we'd expect the bot to reply with. 

`Actual Result:` This is what the bot is actually replying with or the result of running the command/using the feature.

`Screenshots:` Screenshots of the issue if possible.

`Reproduction:` How we can reproduce the bug.

:warning: If you cannot provide all of the information, then please don't submit a bug report. We need all of the information above to identify and resolve the bug.

## Bug Approval

Getting the bug approved is your step to contributing towards the project. For a bug to be approved, we'll first identify if it's intended behvaior or indeed, a bug. We will then resolve the bug and you'll be recorded as submitting a successful and approved report.

After having multiple approved reports, you may wake up with a shiny new badge in the **/meta user** command.

:x: *Make sure you review past reports before you submit yours to make sure it hasn't already been reported*

:x: *Make sure that the bug can be reproduced*

:x: *Never perform bug testing in a public community*
